## Purpose
The objective of this challenge is to study the temperatures on Oahu through June and December to determine if an icecream business would be sustainable there. I obtained minimum, maximum and average temperatures through a query. 

## Results

I was able to retrieve 1700 temperature recordings from the month of June, the collection of which featured a max of 85, min of 64, and mean of 74. The lower standard deviation of 3.25 indicates fluctiation of temperatures isn't that big, so it's a relatively steady climate to operate in.

I was similarly able to retrieve 1517 temperature recordings from the month of December, the collection of which featured a max of 83, min of 56, and mean of 71. The lower standard deviation of 3.74 indicates fluctiation of temperatures isn't that big, so it's a relatively steady climate to operate in. 

## Key Differences
The months of June and December have a few key differences:
- June has more data available
- June has higher temperatures by a few degrees, which is expected in relation to a winter month
- December has a slightly higher spread of data with a higher standard deviation

## Additional Query
Additional query that could be included in the next exercise might include analyzing what weather recordings come from different weather stations, as there were several stations takng these measurements. Certain stations may have made more accurate readings than others. The rainfall query can also be used to determine which months would have more transportation/climate complications for an icecream shop.

## Conclusion
Overall, an ice cream business would be advisable, as the temperature and climate would not be significant factors of opposition.
